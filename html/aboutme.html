          <p class="about-text">For my whole life I have been interested in cars, racing, and technology. I love to learn how things work. 
            Most of my life I have been a mechanic and have worked on cars built in the 50s all the way to working on helicopters during my
          time in the military. In the last few years I have gotten more hands on in tech, I have always been the family IT guy but never 
          been in IT or Programming until recently.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2018 I beamce ill with a neurological virus that left me bed ridden for a long time. To pass the time I started teaching myself how to code. 
          Eventually I landed a part-time job while I was recovering. One of my main responsibilites was maintaining and developing websites on the Shopify platform. 
          That helped grow my desire to learn how to code. I enjoy building something or fixing something like when I was a mechanic, but its nice to have clean hands 
          at the end of the day! 
          <br>
          <br>
          My goal is to become a Web Developer professionally and to maybe transfer my love of coding to my first love,
          cars and motorsports.
